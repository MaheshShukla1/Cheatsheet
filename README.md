# Google Dork Cheatsheet

## What Is a Google Dork?

A ‚ÄúGoogle dork‚Äù is an advanced Google search technique. ‚ÄúGoogle dorking‚Äù (aka ‚ÄúGoogle hacking‚Äù) is the activity of performing advanced searches on Google. You can combine different Google dorks to comb data otherwise inaccessible to ordinary users of Google search.

On a browser, if you make too many Google searches in a short time, Google requires that you unscramble garbled letters in an image called a captcha before you can proceed. Captcha completion can frustrate end users like you, but Google servers must nip denial-of-service cyberattacks in the bud.

Unlike most cheat sheets, we cannot guarantee that the commands below will remain unchanged in perpetuity. Google updates its dorks continually, so deprecated techniques don‚Äôt appear here, even if you can find them elsewhere on the Internet.

### Before You Begin Google Dorking

Google dorking is not a playground where you can flood commands to your heart‚Äôs content:

- Google limits your Google search rate from a single device.
- It may ban your IP if you issue too many queries.
- Abuse of dorks may have legal repercussions.

No, you‚Äôre not immune even if you‚Äôre working from a virtual machine toying with¬†[sqlmap](https://www.stationx.net/sqlmap-cheat-sheet/).

If you know you can‚Äôt resist having fun with it (and you will), you could work from¬†[Pagodo](https://github.com/opsdisk/pagodo), which automates Google searching for potentially vulnerable web pages and applications on the Internet. It also lets you¬†[automate the rate](https://github.com/opsdisk/pagodo#wait-time-between-google-dork-searchers)¬†at which your device issues Google dorks.

Regardless of how you use Google dorks, respect Google‚Äôs¬†[Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms). Be careful.

### Examples of Creepy Dorks

These dorks reveal vulnerabilities in websites, and their contents may be newsworthy depending on the zeitgeist.

For details on how the following commands work, refer to¬†[Text dorks](https://www.stationx.net/google-dorks-cheat-sheet/#text-dorks),¬†[Google Dorks Operators](https://www.stationx.net/google-dorks-cheat-sheet/#google-dorks-operators), and¬†[Scope-Restricting Dorks](https://www.stationx.net/google-dorks-cheat-sheet/#scope-restricting-dorks).

## Google Dorks Search Parameters

A search parameter in a Google dork is the text string payload affixed to or used with the Google dorking command or operator. Without a suitable search parameter, Google treats the dork keyword as an ordinary query keyword at best and returns zero results at worst.

For example, in the search¬†[site:www.stationx.net](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awww.stationx.net), the domain ‚Äúwww.stationx.net‚Äù is the parameter. In¬†[(psychology OR computer science) AND design](https://www.google.com/search?q=%28psychology+OR+computer+science%29+AND+design), the three subjects of psychology, computer science, and design are the parameters. In¬†[16 F to C](https://www.google.com/search?q=16+F+to+C)¬†(converting a temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius), 16 is the parameter.

Search parameters include web domains, file extensions, numbers, and character strings with or without quotes.

## Google Dorking Commands

As Google‚Äôs internal documentation on dorks frequently changes, the following is not an exhaustive list but a list of commands known to return meaningful results. Some of the given commands may be obsolete because they return similar results as a dork-free search. Deprecated commands don‚Äôt appear below.

### Scope-Restricting Dorks

These help specify your target range of websites or data types. For example, in hunting for e-books, the Google dork ‚Äúfiletype:pdf‚Äù is indispensable.

If a command listed below ends with a symbol, include no space between the command and the parameter. The correct way to use each command is in the ‚ÄúExample usage‚Äù column. Otherwise, Google will treat the command as an ordinary search keyword rather than a dork.

### Text Dorks

These are helpful if you want to look for web pages containing certain text strings or follow particular patterns. For example, those familiar with the URLs of webcam apps, for example, use Google dorks similar to the first entry in¬†[this table](https://www.stationx.net/google-dorks-cheat-sheet/#this-table)¬†to find camera footage to watch.

## Google Dorks Operators

Unlike certain Google Dorking commands, you may include spaces between Google dorking operators and your query items. You may combine as many different operators and commands as are necessary.

### Search

These refine the search and constrain the results to follow the rules of logic. Most of the following are logical operators.

## How to Prevent Google Dorks

With great power comes great responsibility, and even if you use Google Dorks with the utmost care, other entities may not. Here are some suggestions to avoid becoming the next victim of unwanted Google Dorking.

- Implement IP-based restrictions and password authentication to protect private areas. Securing your login portals discourages unauthorized access.
- Encrypt all sensitive information, like usernames, passwords, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses. This way, in the event of data leakage, the original data remains unexposed.
- Run vulnerability scans to find and disable Google dorks. Examples of vulnerability scanners are¬†[nmap](https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/),¬†[Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-faq#:~:text=Nessus%C2%AE%20Essentials%20is%20free,16%20IP%20addresses%20per%20scanner.), and¬†[Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/support/faq/general/#:~:text=Qualys%20Web%20Application%20Scanning%20(WAS,(XSS)%20and%20SQL%20injection.).
- Run regular dork queries on your website to discover loopholes and sensitive information before attacks occur.¬†[Sqlmap](https://www.stationx.net/sqlmap-cheat-sheet/)¬†is a helpful tool.
- If you find sensitive content exposed on your website and you‚Äôve exhausted all other means of removing it (such as changing your passwords or renaming your login pages), request its removal through¬†[Google Search Console](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1663419?hl=en).
- Be judicious in the use of¬†`robots.txt`. Read the¬†[warning](https://www.stationx.net/google-dorks-cheat-sheet/#word-of-caution)¬†below.

Other websites mentioning Google Dorks typically recommend using robots.txt to conceal sensitive content or to stop Google from indexing specific parts of your website. On your website server, you can find¬†`robots.txt`¬†in the root-level directory, such as¬†`/public_html`.

What seems like a simple, good-faith solution to eliminate complex reconnaissance via Google Dorks is, to an intelligent hacker, a treasure trove and a cash cow. Instead of backing off, they‚Äôll attack your website by targeting the items listed in¬†`robots.txt`.
